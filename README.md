Sales-Prediction-Using-Time-Series-Forcasting
Overview

This project focuses on building a sales prediction model for the Rossmann Store Sales dataset. Predicting sales is critical for businesses to manage inventory, staffing, and marketing strategies effectively. The task involved exploring time-series data, applying feature engineering, and training predictive models using two different approaches:

    XGBoost Regressor - XGBoost leverages tree-based ensemble learning for structured data.
    LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) - A deep learning model suited for sequential data. LSTM is a neural network designed to capture temporal dependencies in sequential datasets.
